# XSL

The original XSL can be found [here](https://github.com/SEMICeu/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap)

The xsl in this repository has been formatted for readability and editor support/code completion.
The DeltaXML 'XSLT/XPath for Visual Studio Code' extension is used, together with the saxon-he.12.5 xslt processor.
